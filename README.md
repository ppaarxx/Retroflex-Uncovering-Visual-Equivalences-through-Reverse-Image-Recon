# Retroflex-Uncovering-Visual-Equivalences-through-Reverse-Image-Recon
This Project introduces a comprehensive method for Reverse Image Search (RIS) this can be also called as CBIR that is Content Based Image Retrieval designed for large datasets with more than 50,000 photos in 25 different classes. The approach uses sophisticated deep learning feature extraction methods, such as Auto-encoders and CNNs, to extract complex visual representations for reliable content characterization. We incorporate advanced indexing techniques to address the issues of scalability and retrieval efficiency. The resultant framework exhibits higher accuracy and speed and provides an optimal and sophisticated solution for picture retrieval problems. This effort is a major step forward in improving the capabilities of RIS systems, offering a flexible tool for real-world applications that need for thorough and effective image retrieval across a range of classes.
